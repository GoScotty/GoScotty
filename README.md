- 👋 Hi, I’m Scotty
- 👀 I’m interested in applying machine learning to financial forecasting, particularly in predicting stock futures, options, and market behavior. I'm exploring time-series modeling, transformer-based architectures, and reinforcement learning strategies that blend financial theory with real-world volatility and noise.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning robotics and intelligent automation, focusing on how AI and machine learning can power perception, control, and motion planning. I'm exploring ROS, computer vision, and reinforcement learning with real-world applications in robotics systems, autonomy, and embedded AI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with AI VCs and startup teams on innovative, scalable ML solutions—from ideation to deployment.
- 📫 The best way to connect is through LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out if you're building in AI, robotics, fintech, or are exploring innovative collaboration. I'm always open to bold ideas and impactful conversations. 📧 scottsarra4@gmail.com
